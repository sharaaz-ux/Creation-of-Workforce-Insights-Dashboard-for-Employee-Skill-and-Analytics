# AI-Powered-Workforce-Analytics-Talent-Intelligence-Dashboard

Project Statement:
This project focuses on developing an AI-Powered Workforce Analytics & Talent Intelligence Dashboard that enables organizations to gain actionable insights into workforce performance, employee engagement, talent development, diversity, attrition, recruitment effectiveness, and organizational health. The solution leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), predictive analytics, and agentic AI workflows to transform disparate HR and workforce data into strategic business intelligence. By automating real-time analytics and conversational querying, the platform empowers HR leaders and executives to make data-driven decisions regarding workforce planning, retention strategies, and skill development, ultimately allowing organizations to proactively address talent challenges and optimize organizational performance.

# Outcomes:
- Comprehensive visibility into workforce performance, demographics, and organizational trends.
- Predictive analytics to identify attrition risks and recommend proactive retention strategies.
- Actionable insights into employee skills, learning progress, and career development.
- Monitoring of diversity, equity, and inclusion metrics across the organization.
- Intelligent, AI-powered recommendations for workforce planning and engagement.
- Natural language interaction for rapid, data-driven workforce intelligence.

The following workflow describes the complete end-to-end data flow of the architecture, from data collection to AI-powered insights for business users.
Step 1: Data Collection from Multiple Sources
The workflow begins by collecting workforce-related data from multiple enterprise sources.
Data Sources
- Kaggle HR Dataset (Primary Dataset)
- HRMS (Human Resource Management System)
- Recruitment Portal
- The Kaggle dataset acts as the primary data source, while synthetic employee records are generated and distributed across multiple systems to simulate a real enterprise environment.
Output: Raw HR data from different platforms.

Step 2: Split Dataset into Multiple Data Sources
The primary HR dataset is divided and stored across different data repositories to mimic real-world organizational data storage.
Data Repositories
- Oracle Database
- Snowflake Data Warehouse
- REST API
- Each source contains a portion of the HR information, representing how organizations manage data across multiple systems.
Output: Distributed HR datasets ready for ingestion.

Step 3: Workflow Orchestration using Apache Airflow
Apache Airflow manages and automates the entire data pipeline.
Its responsibilities include:
- Scheduling workflow execution
- Triggering ingestion jobs
- Coordinating AWS Glue ETL processes
- Monitoring pipeline status
- Sending alerts on failures
- Automating DAG execution
- Airflow ensures that every stage of the workflow executes in the correct order without manual intervention.
Output: Automated and orchestrated data pipeline.

Step 4: Data Lake Storage (Amazon S3 – Medallion Architecture)
The collected data is stored in Amazon S3 following the Medallion Architecture.
Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- Stores raw, unprocessed data exactly as received.
- Serves as the original source for future processing.
Silver Layer (Clean Data)
- AWS Glue cleans and validates the raw data by:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing formats
- Performing data validation
Gold Layer (Curated Data)
The cleaned data is transformed into business-ready datasets through:
- Aggregation
- Feature engineering
- KPI generation
- Department-wise summaries
- Workforce analytics metrics
Output: High-quality curated datasets ready for analytics and machine learning.



Step 5: ETL and Data Processing using AWS Glue
AWS Glue performs the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations.
The ETL pipeline includes:
- Data extraction from Oracle, Snowflake, and REST APIs
- Data cleaning
- Data validation
- Data transformation
- Data normalization
- Loading processed data into the Silver and Gold layers
- AWS Glue creates standardized datasets suitable for reporting and AI model training.
Output: Processed and analytics-ready workforce data.

Step 6: Automation using AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda executes serverless automation tasks throughout the pipeline.
Its functions include:
- Triggering ETL jobs
- Running scheduled workflows
- Automating processing tasks
- Responding to events such as new data uploads
- Integrating different AWS services
- Lambda reduces manual effort and enables real-time pipeline execution.
Output: Fully automated workflow execution.

Step 7: AI/ML and Intelligence Layer
The processed Gold-layer data is used to build AI and machine learning models.
Amazon SageMaker
Amazon SageMaker is responsible for:
- Training machine learning models
- Workforce prediction
- Employee attrition prediction
- Performance analytics
- Workforce trend analysis
- HR forecasting
Vector Database
A Vector Database stores text embeddings generated from HR documents and processed datasets.
It supports:
- Semantic search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Context-aware AI responses
- Intelligent document retrieval
- This enables the AI agent to retrieve relevant HR information efficiently.
Output: Predictive insights and searchable knowledge base.

Step 8: AI Agent and Visualization (Amazon Bedrock)
Amazon Bedrock powers the conversational AI assistant using Large Language Models (LLMs).
The AI agent performs:
- Natural language query processing
- AI-powered HR recommendations
- Conversational analytics
- Intelligent workforce insights
- Context-aware responses using the Vector Database
- Dashboard visualization support
Users can ask questions such as:
- "Which department has the highest attrition?"
- "Predict employees at risk of leaving."
- "Show average performance by department."
The AI agent retrieves relevant information and generates intelligent responses supported by the processed data.
Output: Interactive AI assistant and business intelligence dashboards.

Step 9: End Users
The final insights are delivered to business stakeholders.
Target Users
- HR Managers
- Executives
- Business Leaders
- They use the platform for:
- Data-driven decision making
- Strategic workforce planning
- Talent management
- Employee performance analysis
- Attrition monitoring
- Business growth planning
